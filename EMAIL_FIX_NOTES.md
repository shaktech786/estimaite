# Email Configuration Fix - Resend Domain Verification

## Issue Identified
The feedback system was not sending emails due to domain verification requirements with Resend.

## Root Cause
- Original configuration used `FROM_EMAIL=hi@shak-tech.com`
- The domain `shak-tech.com` was not verified in the Resend dashboard
- Resend requires domain verification for custom sending domains

## Solution Applied
Updated email configuration to use Resend's default domain:
- `FROM_EMAIL=noreply@resend.dev` (Resend's verified domain)
- `FEEDBACK_EMAIL=shakeel.bhamani@gmail.com` (your verified email)

## Testing Results
✅ Email sending now works correctly
✅ Feedback API successfully sends emails
✅ Message ID: 7f0eaa30-c451-436b-a824-a8db35998247 (test email)

## Production Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Current Configuration (Recommended for Quick Start)
- Emails will come from `noreply@resend.dev`
- Works immediately without additional setup
- Perfect for development and testing

### Option 2: Verify Your Domain (For Professional Branding)
1. Go to https://resend.com/domains
2. Add `shak-tech.com` as a domain
3. Follow DNS verification steps (add TXT/CNAME records)
4. Once verified, update `FROM_EMAIL=noreply@shak-tech.com`

### Option 3: Use a Subdomain
- Use `noreply@mail.shak-tech.com` or similar
- May be easier to verify than the root domain

## Environment Variables
```bash
# Working configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_aaHwEq9D_7KMLWHMwZyBQDSf1VHSmx9S3

## Next Steps

4. Monitor Resend dashboard for delivery analytics
