# EstimAIte Quick Start Guide

## ü§ñ GitHub Copilot Setup Prompt

Use GitHub Copilot in agentic mode to automatically set up and run EstimAIte. To access agentic mode, open the GitHub Copilot Chat panel in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I), then click the "Agentic" button in the top right of the chat panel.

Copy and paste the following prompt into the chat:

```
Help me set up and run the EstimAIte planning poker application. I need you to:
1. Check if I have Node.js v22+ and npm v10+ installed (install them if needed)
2. Set up a free Pusher account (https://pusher.com) to get API credentials
3. Create a .env.local file with my Pusher credentials and OpenAI API key
4. Install all dependencies from package.json
5. Run the development server
6. Open the application in my browser
7. Guide me through creating my first planning poker session

I want to use this for team estimation sessions where any team member can add a story (by title only), start votes, reveal estimates, and control the timer. This should be a real-time collaborative application where all participants can see updates instantly.

For AI features, I'll use my OpenAI API key to analyze story complexity and provide estimation suggestions. If I don't have one, please guide me through setting up alternatives or running without AI features.

After setup, I'll need to know how to:
- Share the room code with my team members
- Submit a user story with just a title
- Start the voting process
- Reveal estimates when everyone has voted
- Reset for the next estimation round
```
